Common DDL Commands in Oracle
  Command	Purpose
    -- CREATE	Create new database objects
    -- ALTER	Modify existing objects
    -- RENAME	Rename database objects
    -- TRUNCATE	Quickly remove all rows from a table
    -- DROP	Delete objects permanently


1. CREATE — Create New Tables or Objects
  The CREATE command is used to define new tables or other database objects.

Example. Create a New Table.

    CREATE TABLE EMP_IND (
      empno     NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
      ename     VARCHAR2(50),
      nickname  VARCHAR2(50),
      email     VARCHAR2(100)
    );


SQL
Explanation: This creates a table named EMP_IND with 4 columns, where empno is set as the primary key.

2. ALTER — Modify Existing Table Structures
  The ALTER command lets you make structural changes to an existing table.

    2.1 Add Column(s)
    Add Single Column
    
    ALTER TABLE EMP_IND
    ADD gender VARCHAR2(10);
    SQL
    Add Multiple Columns
    
    ALTER TABLE EMP_IND
    ADD (
      age        NUMBER,
      department VARCHAR2(50)
    );
    
SQL
    2.2 Modify Column(s)
    Modify Single Column
    
    ALTER TABLE EMP_IND
    MODIFY ename VARCHAR2(100);
    
SQL
    Modify Multiple Columns
    
    ALTER TABLE EMP_IND
    MODIFY (
      nickname VARCHAR2(100),
      email    VARCHAR2(150)
    );
    
SQL
    2.3 Drop Column(s)
    Drop Single Column
    
    ALTER TABLE EMP_IND
    DROP COLUMN gender;
    SQL
    Drop Multiple Columns
    
    ALTER TABLE EMP_IND
    DROP (age, department);
    
SQL
    2.4 Rename a Column
    ALTER TABLE EMP_IND
    RENAME COLUMN nickname TO short_name;
    
SQL
    Note. You can rename only one column at a time.

3. RENAME — Rename Table Names
  Used to rename the entire table.

Example

ALTER TABLE EMP_IND
RENAME TO EMPLOYEE_MASTER;

SQL
Effect: The table EMP_IND is now renamed to EMPLOYEE_MASTER.

4. TRUNCATE — Quickly Remove All Records from a Table
Removes all rows from a table, retaining its structure for future use.

Example

TRUNCATE TABLE EMPLOYEE_MASTER;

SQL
Key Points

Faster than DELETE
Cannot be rolled back
Keeps the table definition intact

5. DROP — Delete Tables Permanently
Deletes the entire table, including its data and structure.

Example

DROP TABLE EMPLOYEE_MASTER;

SQL
Effect: The table is permanently removed from the database (unless Flashback features are enabled).

Summary Table of DDL Commands
Command	Purpose	Rollback Allowed?
CREATE	Create new database objects	No
ALTER	Modify table structure	No
RENAME	Rename the table or columns	No
TRUNCATE	Quickly remove all data from a table	No
DROP	Permanently delete a table	No
Important Notes
DDL operations are auto-committed
Changes are saved immediately and cannot be undone.
Always take a backup before running destructive DDL commands, such as TRUNCATE or DROP.
Use DDL carefully in production environments to prevent accidental data loss.
Conclusion
Mastering DDL commands is essential for every Oracle developer and DBA. These commands allow you to.

Define and change table structures.
Manage columns, constraints, and indexes.
Control schema changes safely and effectively.
